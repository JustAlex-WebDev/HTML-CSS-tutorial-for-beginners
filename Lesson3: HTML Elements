HTML Elements
-An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
-The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

Example:
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname> 

Examples of some HTML elements:
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p> 




Nested HTML Elements
-HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
-All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
-The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html> 

Example Explained:
-The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.
-It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.
-Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element:

<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body> 

-The <body> element defines the document's body.
-It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.
-Then, inside the <body> element there are two other elements: <h1> and <p>:

Example:
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p> 

Example Explained:
-The <h1> element defines a heading.
-It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

-The <p> element defines a paragraph.
-It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p>:

<p>My first paragraph.</p>

Never Skip the End Tag
-Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag:

Example:
<html>
<body>

<p>This is a paragraph
<p>This is a paragraph

</body>
</html> 

-However, never rely on this! Unexpected results and errors may occur if you forget the end tag!




Empty HTML Elements
-HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
-The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:

Example:
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
