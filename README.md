# HTML-tutorial-for-beginers

In this repository, I will be teaching you guys HTML.
So if you are looking for a career in web development
or you are taking college classes and learning HTML
is required or perhaps you want to learn how to
own website then look no further because
you are in the right place!

I will do my best in presenting the content as
short and easily understanding as well as visually appealing!
