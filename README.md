# HTML-CSS-tutorial-for-beginners

In this repository, I will be teaching you guys some basic HTML and CSS.
So if you are looking for a career in web development
or you are taking college classes and learning HTML or CSS
is required or perhaps you want to learn how to
own website then look no further because
you are in the right place!

I will do my best in presenting the content as
easily understanding and visually appealing as i could!
